# ü§ñ AI RealTime Detection Of DamagedRoad & LaneDetection

This project is an advanced simulation of a self-driving car's perception system, using computer vision to perform real-time lane detection and identify damaged road conditions like potholes.

The application can process both pre-recorded videos and live camera streams, making it a robust proof-of-concept for autonomous driving assistance systems.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-Time Lane Detection:** Implements Hough Transform and computer vision techniques to accurately identify and track lane lines on the road.
- **Pothole & Damaged Road Detection:** A key safety feature that can identify potential hazards on the road surface.
- **Dual Mode Operation:**
    - **Video File Analysis:** Process any pre-recorded video of a road to test the detection algorithms.
    - **Live Camera Feed:** Use a webcam to perform lane and hazard detection in real-time.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** A simple and clean UI built with Flask to upload videos and view the processed output.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Utilizes efficient computer vision libraries like OpenCV for real-time processing capabilities.

## üèÅ Getting Started: How to Run Locally

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ and Pip
- Git and [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) must be installed.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    *This command will also download the large video files handled by Git LFS.*
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/CodewithShaaz/AI-RealTime-Detection-Of-DamagedRoad-LaneDetection.git](https://github.com/CodewithShaaz/AI-RealTime-Detection-Of-DamagedRoad-LaneDetection.git)
    cd AI-RealTime-Detection-Of-DamagedRoad-LaneDetection
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist yet, create it with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to the Code directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Code
    ```

2.  **Run the Flask app:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

3.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to see the application live.
